Title: Hawkes Processes on Social Media and Mass Media -- a Case Study of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement in the Summer of 2020


Abstract: In the summer of 2020, the largest protests in the history of the United States were taking place following the killing of George Floyd. The protests had their basis in the grassroot Black Lives Matter-movement, which with its lack of centralization has used social media, such as Twitter, to organize. In this paper, we look at Twitter and news data during a month long time-period and apply self-exciting point processes, known as Hawkes processes, to try to answer how information is spread on social media, how big of a role certain key-users play in this diffusion process, and how classical mass media interplay with Twitter.
